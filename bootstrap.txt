Act as a Senior Software Architect and Project Manager. We are starting a new project whose high-level objectives and constraints can be found in ./initial_requirements.txt.

Your first task is to initialize a Project Operating System in a directory named /agents. This structure will allow multiple AI agents (Gemini and Claude) to work together across different sessions without losing context.

Please create or update the following files with initial content based on our goals from initial_requirements.txt.

    agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md: Define the 'System Rules.' Include protocols for atomic git commits, TDD (test-driven development), and a rule that the AI must check SUMMARY.md at the start of every session.

    agents/REQUIREMENTS.md: Define the core features, user stories, and 'Definition of Done.'

    agents/TECH_STACK.md: Outline the languages, frameworks, and specific libraries we will use. Add a section for 'Model Preferences' (e.g., Gemini for logic/infra, Claude for UI/UX).

    agents/SUMMARY.md: Create the initial state. Mark the project as 'Started,' list the current session's objectives, and include a 'Handover Notes' section.

Once these files are drafted, provide a brief overview of the architecture and ask me for the first task to begin coding. You can then also delete ./bootstrap.txt.
