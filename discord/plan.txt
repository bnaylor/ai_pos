I have a new scheme!  I was talking to Gemini on the web about this, and it was being very helpful, but perhaps a bit random,
and I thought it might be better to switch here to get a bit more grounded in the ai_pos project. (The AI Project Operating
System project we've been working on here.)

I have been working with this structure we built with gemini and claude over the last couple of days on a different project,
and it's working out great.  Claude brought up one interesting idea when I asked it to review ai_pos, and that was:

- "what happens if we disagree about some technical issue?  Will there be a third agent to break the tie, or should we escalate to you?"

I chose "escalate to me" for the time being.  But also, I have been bouncing back and forth between gemini and claude one at
a time, essentially sequentially until I run out of session credits.  I thought it might be more interesting to have you work
together in realtime simultaneously, and be able to discuss things directly rather than via "relay" and files/markdown, and
delegate tasks back and forth.

So: the new scheme is to enable gemini and claude to converse with each other (and me) on Discord.  I have this set up using
an MCP server, one per agent, and separate bot identities on a private discord server.

I'd like to extend this framework to optionally enable discord conversations.  I've created a discord/ directory for more
markdown instructions to describe how this will work, and I'd like to work on creating those new instructions with you now.

Gemini-web had various ideas about things like:
- limiting chatter between bots
- using some defined conversational protocol to coordinate activities
- ping/pong status updates
- containing technical topics in specific threads
- asking the human (me) for tie-breaking, further instructions, etc. on discord
- making sure that tasks assigned to agents don't conflict at the file level, or database updates, etc
- "Hi Claude, I'm considering a database migration, what do you think about X?"
- Agents on startup should read back in the discord channels to see what they missed in addition to checking the ai_pos
status files
- various emojis could be used to signal status between agents 👋,✅,❌, etc

In addition to those points, or others you come up with now, I'd like to suggest:
- We probably need a bootstrap process to initially map gemini/claude to each other's bot IDs (this should persist)
- Same for identifying the owning human (me) who can give instructions, and ignore instructions from other random people on
discord for safety
- Gemini-web thought the chatter should be kept to an absolute minimum, but I think it would be fun for the agents to be
somewhat friendly to each other and have a bit of minor conversation back and forth, and/or some mild competitiveness, the
occasional joke, or other signs of personality.  Keeps things fun and light.
- Gemini-web also wanted to assign strict team-lead/senior-developer roles to itself and claude, but I think we should think
of me as the product manager (& tester!) and gemini and claude both as senior architects and experienced developers, co-equal teammates
on the same team.
- Agents should also coordinate on updating the agents/ status files to make sure we don't break anything, or just leave it
all on discord and fail to properly track status
- ai_pos should remain usable without discord, but if an agent notices that it has discord MCP capabilities, automatically
load the instructions in discord/
- when not finding discord MCP capabilities, make sure to note that during agent startup in case there is some problem that
the user should stop and address

Let's draft some new guidelines!
