<!-- Example entry:

### 001 - Use Zustand over Redux for state management
- **Date:** 2024-01-15
- **Context:** Needed client-side state management for the dashboard
- **Decision:** Zustand
- **Rationale:** Simpler API, smaller bundle size, sufficient for our needs. Redux's middleware ecosystem wasn't required.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Redux Toolkit, Jotai, React Context
